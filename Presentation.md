## Studio X Ticker

![Image](http://i.imgur.com/dvBSjeG.jpg)

An occupancy ticker provides real time data as people move in and out of Studio X.


### Another Section

### All Studio X locations will have international tickers, providing real time occupancy data

#### The set up will utilize two motion sensors, hooked up to a mini Rasperry Pi computer which transmits data to the cloud.

##VIBE

A grid of sound sensors is embedded within Studio-X New York to detect sound (vibrations) and map out the activity "vibe" of the space.

###Description

![Scenario GIF] (https://raw.github.com/yz2428/site2site.github.io/master/images/Vibe/studio-x_VIBE.gif)

Tapping into the constant hum of the workplace, Vibe is able to extract a range of information about the different uses of a space based on qualitative and temporal aspects associated with sound.

![Plan Schematic] (https://raw.github.com/jnquick/Studio-Analytics/master/Images/vibe-schematic.jpg)

Vibe is comprised of a distributed, discreet network of microphones within the Studio-X space which are able to measure the frequency, intensity, and duration of sound rather than focus on content.

With this information, we may be able to map particular zones of interest, or utilize the quantitative information generated through this process as a basis for interaction with other proposals.

## Section NÂº3

### In Markdown you can insert regular HTML, so it's easy to, say, insert a video from Youtube (be sure to use the old embed code).

<object width="1024" height="500"><param name="movie" value="//www.youtube.com/v/khwQ9lf2DJQ?hl=en_US&amp;version=3"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="//www.youtube.com/v/khwQ9lf2DJQ?hl=en_US&amp;version=3" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="1024" height="768" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object>

You should understand the video above like an image, it will be scaled to fit the page if you just insert the code.

### But, if you an \* and a tab infront of it, it will scale to a max-width of 500px.
